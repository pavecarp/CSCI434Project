<h2>About The Owner</h2>
<p>Stephen Carpenter was born to one loving parent and one world-class saltwater fisherman.
Despite his mother's incredible maternal instincts and immeasurable love, Stephen couldn't 
resist the call of the ocean and his father's wealth and complete disregard for responsibility.
At the age of 8, Stephen packed up his Lightning McQueen suitcase full of homemade fly lures, 
moisture-wicking t-shirts, and SPF-50 sunscreen and walked two spaces down the boat dock to his 
father's boathouse to begin his apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Twenty years later, after setting numerous fishing records and completing his Ph.D. in 
making cool boats, Stephen founded Black Ibis Boats.  Today, Black Ibis Boats are known 
worldwide for their cool looks and visible floating properties.</p>
